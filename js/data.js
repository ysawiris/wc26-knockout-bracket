/* ============================================================
   LEAGUE DATA — knockout-stage seed + config.

   "The Longest Yard" snake-drafts 2 of the 32 Round-of-32
   countries to each of its 12 teams. Rank = sum of knockout
   advancement points (R32=3, R16=5, QF=8, SF=13, Final=21)
   plus a small per-goal bonus. Cards/fouls are DISPLAY ONLY
   and never affect scoring.

   Goals normally update themselves: a GitHub Action pulls a
   live feed into data/live.json, which overlays onto FIELD.
   Manual edits to a country's `goals` only take effect when
   the live feed is down. The draft is a GATE — the hub stays
   locked until all 24 picks are in.
